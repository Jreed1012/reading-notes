What is Active Directory?
What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides?
      Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft’s directory and identity management service for   Windows domain networks. 
Active Directory Domain Services – the core Active Directory service used to manage users and resources.
Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services – a low-overhead version of AD DS for directory-enabled applications.

What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?
A domain is a collection of objects (e.g. users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database. A domain is identified by a DNS name like company.com.
A tree is a collection of one or more domains with a contiguous namespace (they have a common DNS root name like marketing.company.com, engineering.company.com, and sales.company.com).
A forest is a collection of one or more trees that share a common schema, global catalog, and directory configuration—but aren’t part of a contiguous namespace. The forest typically serves as the security boundary for an enterprise network.
How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped?
Objects within a domain can be grouped into organizational units (OUs) to simplify administration and policy management.

Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.
        		An active directory gives you access to a computer within a network using information unique to its user.
