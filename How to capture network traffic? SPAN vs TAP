How to capture network traffic? SPAN vs TAP

What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
port mirroring (commonly called SPAN) & TAP (Terminal Access Point)

Port mirroring, also known as SPAN or roving analysis, is a method of monitoring network traffic which forwards a copy of each incoming and/or outgoing packet from one (or several) port(s) (or VLAN) of a switch to another port where the analysis device is connected. 

A network TAP (Terminal Access Point) is a hardware device which can passively capture traffic on a network. It is commonly used to monitor the traffic between two points in the network.

What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?
APS

How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
A good way to capture traffic on several ports at once
TAPs can also be used in security applications because they are non-obtrusive, are not detectable on the network, can deal with full-duplex and non-shared networks, and will usually pass-through traffic even if the tap stops working or loses power.

Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?
Not appropriate for the observation of a narrow traffic range
